# FarmShare Investment & Produce Marketplace

## Description
FarmShare is designed to address a critical gap in Sri Lanka's agricultural investment system. Farmers often struggle to secure funding for their farms each season, relying on **bank loans or selling valuable assets** like gold. If the farm is destroyed due to weather or other factors, farmers **lose everything**, as they have no alternative income to repay their loans. This cycle of debt creates significant financial instability.

FarmShare solves this problem by introducing a **stock-based investment system**. Instead of relying on loans, farmers can **sell stock units** to investors, where **1 kg of farm output equals 1 stock unit**. This allows farmers to raise funds without financial risk, while investors gain a **structured, data-driven way** to invest in agriculture.

### Risk Score & Dynamic Stock Price Calculation
FarmShare calculates **risk scores** using **real-time weather data and soil conditions**:
- **Weather Risk Score** is derived from **temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and humidity** using a weather API.
- **Soil Risk Score** is based on **nutrient levels, organic matter, moisture content, and soil pH**, which the farmer provides.
- **Final Risk Score** = (Weather Risk Score + Soil Risk Score) / 2

Stock prices are **dynamically adjusted** based on the **risk score**, ensuring that investors make informed decisions. A **high-risk score** lowers stock prices to attract investors, while a **low-risk score** increases stock prices, reflecting a stable farm.
